  "Docker is required to host this app yourself. To install and run the GitHub app first pull the image using `docker pull ghcr.io/ijskoud/ijsblokje:github-bot` and after that run it using `docker run --name=ijsblokje-github-bot -v ~/.env:/ijsblokje/.env -d ghcr.io/ijskoud/ijsblokje:github-bot`, you can do the same with the Discord bot.",
