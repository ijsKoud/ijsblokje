## Information

IJsblokje is my co-pilot for GitHub operations! It is able to:

- üè∑Ô∏è Label PRs automatically according to the conventional commit types
- üîÉ Sync labels across mutliple repositories with the ability to add repository specific ones too
- üîî Automatically adds a [GitCord](https://github.com/ijskoud/gitcord) webhook url to the webhooks everytime a repository is created and toggles it depending on the visibility state
- üóûÔ∏è Syncs the readme's of multiple repositories using a config (`readme.ijsblokje.toml`) and a base readme (which is located at your own account repository -> ijsKoud/ijsKoud)
- üéâ Releases a new version with automatic changelog generation (This can be done via the Discord bot integration)

## Install

Docker is required to host this app yourself. To install and run the GitHub app first pull the image using `docker pull ghcr.io/ijskoud/ijsblokje:github-bot` and after that run it using `docker run --name=ijsblokje-github-bot -v ~/.env:/ijsblokje/.env -d ghcr.io/ijskoud/ijsblokje:github-bot`, you can do the same with the Discord bot.

Alternatively if you would like to use both the GitHub app and Discord bot you can use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to install it. Simply copy the file to a directory on your pc/server, add the required `.env` files (examples are in the designated app directories) and run `docker-compose up`
